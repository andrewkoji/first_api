This is an algebra curriculum that will be built in streamlit. A custom API will be developed with custom programs and applications for
algebra instructors to use in the classroom. 

The business problem:

For too long, students in high school have been stuck learning from pencil and paper assignments while missing many key concepts that can
be explained more effectively with the use of technology. Students struggle with learning mathematical concepts because of the takeover
of texas instruments, causing students to be stuck using the ti84 plus calculator to answer all questions on a high stakes exam. 
Furthermore, the issue compounds itself as there are many math instructors stuck using the tool for instruction as the calculator is the 
only tool allowed on the exam. 

This is a problem for a few reasons:
1. Not every student has access to a TI84 plus calculator.
2. Not every school district has the same access to funding for graphing calculators. 
3. Not all mathematical concepts can be explained as effectively with graphing calculators. 

- Calculator use is a skill that needs to be taught in math classrooms. When kids do not have calculators at home, they can't practice
as they do in class. 
- Being able to compute answers or data information should be more easily accessible. 

This curriculum is an attempt to revamp the algebra curriculum to develop effective instructional deliverables that utilize technology.
Mathematical applications are available but costly. 
Competitors: Mathbits(top pick), Emathinstriuction(popular, but not great), IXL(being phased out)

As long as students need to know algebra, this curriculum will be useful. Yes you need algebra specific material, but the apps will be
developed with conceptual undersranding being the purpose of design at the forefront.
